  React has special events different from the normal events. 
  Instead of onclick or onchange, React has custom events with camelcase
  that automatically set up listeners and scope. 
  These are events like onClick and onChange. They work similarly, but
  have a lot of special code involved. 
  
  Items passed in as attributes are called props.
  These will be inherited as this.props in children
  made by this element.
